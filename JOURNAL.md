# August 13th: Creating the profile sketches!

Created the profile sketches for the side and top of the controller grips using splines. Then experimented in adding additional splines along the length of the grips to try loft the entire grip.

# August 14th: Finished hand grips

Remade the wireframe for the grips using 3d splines and lofted the surfaces to make a solid object that will be the hand grips. This took a lot of trial and error.
