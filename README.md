# 3D printed multipurpose Controller

## About
This is a 3D printed controller designed primarily to be used in robotics to control things such as robotic arms. The idea to create this came after I designed and built my own robotic arm using a couple of servos and an arduino. However, controlling the robotic arm was hard, movement was janky, the arduino was not able to solve the complex inverse kinematics needed for higher DOF and the most annoying thing was that I was controlling the arm using two joysticks hotglued onto a carboard box while physically connected to the robotic arm with a cable. This is why I decided to design and 3D printer a better wireless controller with a sleek and proffessional looking designed inspired by other gamepads. 

With two joysticks, buttons, accelerometer and pots, this controller is able to allow for the control complex movement of robotic arms while offering options for different keybinds for automated movements. The large colour screen, leds and buzzer allow for a large variety of information to be displayed to the user in a format that is accessible and allows for key information to be distinct.

However, what if you want to play some games? There is planned support for intergrating simple games into the controller that can be displayed on the screen and use the large variety of control methods available. For example playing the dino game using the accelerometer by physically jumping. 

The overall goal for the controller is to be modular with support for a variety of functions and can be quickly adapted for different applications.
